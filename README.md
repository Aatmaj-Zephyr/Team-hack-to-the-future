# Wait,Watch,Enable!

Stay alert, don't get hurt ! Now that the covid pandemic which rocked the world is coming to an end, things are returning to normalcy with the working sector being reopened again.
However, home theft and robbery has been surging up to new records as the older generations as well as young kids being home alone,are getting more and more vulnerable. 

To solve this rising problem and provide a sense of safety to the vulnerable demographic...We , team <B><i>HACK TO THE FUTURE</B></i> have developed a mobile application called <b>WaIT,Watch,Enable!</b>

<b><i> Working of Application:</b></i>

Whenever a person arrives at the front door,the cctv camera installed detects his/her face. An old /spare mobile is attached to the doorframe inside the house which takes the data from the cctv and using face detection tech , identifies whether the person is an insider or a stranger and notifies thorugh the app.

If its an acquaintance, then the app displays the name of the person and thus, guarantees that its a person the user is acquainted with. The user has an option to accept or deny the notification. If accepted,then the user can open the door and a notification is sent to the caretaker of the house with the details of the person.If its a stranger, then the user can simply deny the request.

<b><i> Key Features of Application: </b></u>

<ul>
  <li> Safeguards the older demographic as well the young agegroup 
    
        Senior citizens , around the 60+ age group experience mental problems and are vulnerable to thefts. This app would greatly benefit them to provide them safety in their own residence.
        Younger children generally are brash,naive and quite impulsive and hence, prone to crimes such as kidnapping , thus this app would be a relief to parents!

  <li> Promotes reusability of older smartphones,thus conserving resources.  
    
       <p>An older android compatible smartphone can be fixed on the doorframe and be used to run the application.  </p>
